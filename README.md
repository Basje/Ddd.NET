# Ddd.NET
A simple .NET Standard 2.0 library providing some very basic building blocks to bootstrap a Domain-Driven Design approach to application design.

## What it's not
Anywhere near production ready. Or a framework. Did I mention you should not be using this yet? Because you shouldn't.

## How to use
This library contains contracts (interfaces) to base your value types and entities on. Implement the appropriate interfaces in your models.
